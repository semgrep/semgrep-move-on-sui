      Adding Move On Sui Semgrep grammer (#508)
      
      * First instance of adding semgrep grammars for Move-on-Sui language.
      
      Currently everything in the tree-sitter grammer is fully supported and all tests pass.
      
      However, several things are missing from the tree-sitter grammar today:
      - Proper support for annotations
      - Support for scripts
      - The most recent changes to the Move language
      
      * Moving Move on Sui tree-sitter to my branch for accelerated developement
      
      * Added a package to stats, this has a lot of tests that are updated with move as this is a vscode highigher
      
      * Fixing Macro parsing bug due to meta variables eating the $ and 1 only upcase chars
      
      * updating tree-sitter-move-on-sui repo
      
      * Fixing Macros so now macro variables that start with $ parse.
      
      * Simplifying _identifier_or_metavariable
      
      * Adding ellipsis to module_access
